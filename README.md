## NodeJs AutoComplete Search

#### Url

[NodeJs AutoComplete Search](tamkarnodejs.herokuapp.com)

#### What?

A website hosted on heroku, developed in Node Js.

A simple application that allows users to type in search input field that navigates when hitting on enter to google.

#### Features? What is so special about it ?

It has an amazing workshop story, basically, we had a string that contains 10,000 english word.
We converted the string to array, then looped the array and sorted each word in objects relativily to it's first char.

So we developed an object, that has 26 object of the english chars, each object has english words accordingly.

* Used fetch not xhr.
* Local Storage
* Node Js Backend
* Reading dynamiclly from the backend to the frontend

#### Our Goals

History Search through using localStorage Web API
Reading from a big data through sorting the words to it's first char
Using fetch not xhr, ( using not the usual method we saw in our FACN workshops when attaching the backend )

#### Tools used

LocalStorage Web API, for saving user history search, so it highlights what he searched previously when searching in a new session.
Heroku, for deploying.
